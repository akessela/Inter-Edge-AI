- **OpenVINO** "Open Visual Inferencing and Neural Network Optimization." Focucses on optimizing neuralnetwork inference.
- AI at the edge. Self-driving cars, IoT devices, nature cameras, 
- low latency, real time inference
- The Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit is an open source library useful for edge deployment due to its performance maximizations
and pre-trained models

### Types of computer vision models
- Classification
- detection
- Segementation (semantic: all objects of the same class are one, instance: each object of a class is separate (two bikes in an image are two instances)): each pixel is a class

Neural Network architectures for Computer Vision:
- Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD):is an object detection network that combined classification with object detection through the use of default bounding boxes at different network levels.
- ResNet: utilized residual layers to “skip” over sections of layers, helping to avoid the vanishing gradient problem with very deep neural networks. 
- MobileNet: utilized layers like 1x1 convolutions to help cut down on computational complexity and network size, leading to fast inference without substantial decrease in accuracy
- Others: YOLO, Faster RCNN, MobileNet, ResNet, Inception
